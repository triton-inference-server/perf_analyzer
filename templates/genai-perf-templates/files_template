# Generated File Structures

## Overview

This document serves as a guide to understanding the structure and contents of
the files generated  by GenAi-Perf.

## Directory Structure

After running GenAi-Perf, your file tree should contain the following:

```
genai-perf/
├── artifacts/
│   ├── data/
│   └── images/
```

## File Types
Within the artifacts and docs directories, several file types are generated,
including .csv, .json, .html, and .jpeg. Below is a detailed
explanation of each file and its purpose.

### Artifacts Directory

#### Data Subdirectory

The data subdirectory contains the raw and processed performance data files.

##### JSON Files

- inputs.json: This contains the input prompts provided to the LLM during testing.
- profile_export.json: This is provided by Perf Analyzer and contains the timestamps
for each event in the lifecycle of each request. This is low-level data used to calculate
metrics by GenAi-Perf.
- profile_export_genai_perf.json: A JSON of the output of GenAI-Perf as well as
additional details, including the submitted command line arguments.

##### CSV File

- profile_export_genai_perf.csv: A CSV of the output tables printed
in the GenAi-Perf output. These may have more detail than the printed tables.

#### Images Subdirectory

The images subdirectory contains visual representations of the performance
data. All images are in both HTML and JPEG formats.

##### HTML and JPEG Files
- input_sequence_lengths_vs_output_sequence_lengths: A heat map showing the
relationship between input and generated tokens.
- request_latency: A box plot showing request latency.
- time_to_first_token: A box plot showing time to first token.
- token_to_token_vs_output_position: A scatterplot showing token-to-token
time versus output token position.
- ttft_vs_input_sequence_lengths: A scatterplot showing token-to-token time
versus the input sequence lengths.

## Usage Instructions

To use the generated files, navigate to the artifacts/data directory. Then,
the next steps depend on the file format you wish to work with.

### CSV and JSON Files
Open .csv and .json files with spreadsheet or JSON parsing tools for structured
data analysis. These can also be read via a text editor, like Vim.

### HTML Files

View .html visualizations in a web browser for interactive data exploration.

### JPEG Files

Use an image software to open .jpeg images for static visual representations.
