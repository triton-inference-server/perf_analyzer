# Recommended Installation Method

## Triton SDK Container

The recommended way to access Perf Analyzer is to run the pre-built executable
from within the Triton SDK docker container available on the
[NVIDIA GPU Cloud Catalog](https://ngc.nvidia.com/catalog/containers/nvidia:tritonserver).
As long as the SDK container has its network exposed to the address and port of
the inference server, Perf Analyzer will be able to run.

```bash
export RELEASE=<yy.mm> # e.g. to use the release from the end of December of 2024, do `export RELEASE=24.12`

docker run --rm --gpus=all -it --net=host nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:${RELEASE}-py3-sdk

# inside container
perf_analyzer -m <model>
```

# Alternative Installation Methods

- [pip](#pip)
- [Build from Source](#build-from-source)

## pip

```bash
pip install tritonclient

perf_analyzer -m <model>
```

**Warning**: If any runtime dependencies are missing, Perf Analyzer will produce
errors showing which ones are missing. You will need to manually install them.

## Build from Source

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus=all -it --net=host ubuntu:24.04

# inside container, install build/runtime dependencies
apt update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y cmake g++ git libssl-dev nvidia-cuda-toolkit python3 rapidjson-dev zlib1g-dev

git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/triton-inference-server/perf_analyzer.git

mkdir perf_analyzer/build

cmake -B perf_analyzer/build -S perf_analyzer

cmake --build perf_analyzer/build -- -j8

export PATH=$(pwd)/perf_analyzer/build/perf_analyzer/src/perf-analyzer-build:$PATH

perf_analyzer -m <model>
```

- To enable
  [OpenAI mode](benchmarking.md#benchmarking-openai), add
  `-D TRITON_ENABLE_PERF_ANALYZER_OPENAI=ON` to the first `cmake` command.
- To enable
  [C API mode](benchmarking.md#benchmarking-triton-directly-via-c-api), add
  `-D TRITON_ENABLE_PERF_ANALYZER_C_API=ON` to the first `cmake` command.
- To enable [TorchServe backend](benchmarking.md#benchmarking-torchserve), add
  `-D TRITON_ENABLE_PERF_ANALYZER_TS=ON` to the first `cmake` command.
- To enable
  [Tensorflow Serving backend](benchmarking.md#benchmarking-tensorflow-serving),
  add `-D TRITON_ENABLE_PERF_ANALYZER_TFS=ON` to the first `cmake` command.
- To disable
  [CUDA shared memory support](input_data.md#shared-memory) and the dependency
  on CUDA toolkit libraries, add
  `-D TRITON_ENABLE_GPU=OFF` to the first `cmake` command.
