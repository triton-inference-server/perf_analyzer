        This method extracts metric names and values from the raw data. Metric names
        are extracted from the start of each line up to the '{' character, as all metrics
        follow the format 'metric_name{labels} value'. Only metrics defined in
        METRIC_NAME_MAPPING are processed.

        Args:
            data (str): Raw metrics data from the Triton endpoint.

        Example:
            Given the metric data:
            ```
            nv_gpu_power_usage{gpu_uuid="GPU-abschdinjacgdo65gdj7"} 27.01
            nv_gpu_utilization{gpu_uuid="GPU-abcdef123456"} 75.5
            nv_energy_consumption{gpu_uuid="GPU-xyz789"} 1234.56
            ```

            - `nv_gpu_power_usage` as `gpu_power_usage`
