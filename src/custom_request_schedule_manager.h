/// An instance of this load manager will be created at the beginning of the
/// perf analyzer and it will be used to schedule to send requests at that
/// particular second defined by the user. The particular seconds at which a
/// request should be sent can be set by the user using the `schedule` option.
/// For example, if the `schedule` is set to 1,2,4,5,6.5,
/// CustomRequestScheduleManager sends request at 1st second, 2nd second, 4th
/// second and so on.
